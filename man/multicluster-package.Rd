\title{Analyze spatial count data using the flexible spatial scan statistic}
\description{
The rflexscan package provides functions and classes to analyze spatial count
data using the flexible spatial scan statistic developed by Tango and
Takahashi (2005). This package designed for any of the following interrelated
 purposes:
\enumerate{
  \item To evaluate reported spatial disease clusters, to see if they are
        statistically significant.
  \item To test whether a disease is randomly distributed over space.
  \item To perform geographical surveillance of disease, to detect areas of
        significantly high rates.
}
This package implements a wrapper for the C routine used in the FleXScan 3.1.2
developed by Takahashi, Yokoyama, and Tango.
